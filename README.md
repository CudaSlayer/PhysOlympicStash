## The Best Foundational Physics Books

### Level 0: Best Introductory Physics Book for School Students

For me, this is a Level-0 physics which thoroughly prepares you for the must-read Level-1 book mentioned below. üëá

[**Fundamentals Of Physics Extended, 10th Edition**](https://archive.org/details/fundamentals-of-physics) by David Halliday, Jearl Walker, and Robert Resnick

![Fundamentals of Physics Extended 10th Edition Cover](images/halliday_resnick_walker.jpg)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Calculus Preparation

Before jumping on to the Level-1 book. Please go through this fantastic bedside calculus book by Tarasov and two volumes of Piskunov.

- [**Calculus: Basic Concepts for High Schools**](https://archive.org/details/TarasovCalculus) by L.V. Tarasov

  ![Tarasov Calculus](images/tarasov_calculus.jpg)

- [**Differential and Integral Calculus, Volume 1**](https://archive.org/details/piskunov-differential-and-integral-calculus-volume-1-mir) by N. Piskunov

  ![Piskunov Calculus Volume 1](images/piskunov-calculus1.jpg)

- [**Differential and Integral Calculus, Volume 2**](https://archive.org/details/piskunov-differential-and-integral-calculus-volume-2-mir) by N. Piskunov

Please don't go for Maron or Spivak. These are surely overkill at this stage. Always remember your goal is to learn physics.

### Level 1: The Ultimate Physics Foundation

Now, the best Level-1 physics book ever was, is, will be written. If you understand English, this is a must-read book. Read cover-to-cover and solve every damn thing.

[**Physics by Halliday Resnick, Krane - Volume 1**](https://www.amazon.com/Physics-Halliday-Kenneth-Robert-Resnick-ebook/dp/B076DRCPB9) & [**Physics by Halliday Resnick, Krane - Volume 2**](https://www.amazon.com/Physics-2-David-Halliday/dp/0471401943). The Level 0 book mentioned above is essentially a diluted version of this and it requires heavy "application" of calculus.

8 hrs/day for 6 months doing the above and this would get you to a very proficient level in high-school physics.

### Level 1.5: The Irodov Challenge

### üåü BONUS: Level 2.25 - The Soviet Olympiad Crucible üåü

If you've made it this far, you're ready for something truly special. Enter Bukhovtsev's "Problems in Elementary Physics" - a deceptively titled masterpiece that contains some of the most elegant and challenging physics problems ever devised.

This rare Soviet gem represents the pinnacle of pre-university physics problem-solving. Originally designed for the most talented students in specialized physics schools across the USSR, this collection has trained generations of International Physics Olympiad medalists.

What makes this book exceptional:

- **Methodical progression**: Problems are arranged in increasing difficulty within each topic
- **Elegant solutions**: Each problem is a lesson in physical intuition and mathematical finesse
- **Historical significance**: Many problems were used in Soviet physics competitions and early IPhO training

[**Problems in Elementary Physics**](https://archive.org/details/BukhovtsevEtAlProblemsInElementaryPhysics) by B.B. Bukhovtsev, V.D. Krivchenkov, G.Y. Myakishev, and V.P. Shalnov

  ![Bukhovtsev et al Problems in Elementary Physics](images/Bukhovtsev-et-al-Problems-in-Elementary-Physics.jpg)

This Level 2.25 collection is not for the faint of heart. It demands mastery of all previous material and represents the final stepping stone before tackling actual International Physics Olympiad problems. The satisfaction of solving these problems is unparalleled - each one conquered is a badge of honor in your physics journey.

üíé **Pro tip**: Work through this book with a study group. The discussions that emerge from these problems will elevate everyone's understanding to new heights.
