## The Best Foundational Physics Books

### Level 0: Best Introductory Physics Book for School Students

For me, this is a Level-0 physics which thoroughly prepares you for the must-read Level-1 book mentioned below. 👇

[**Fundamentals Of Physics Extended, 10th Edition**](https://archive.org/details/fundamentals-of-physics) by David Halliday, Jearl Walker, and Robert Resnick

### ⚠️ Important Calculus Preparation

Before jumping on to the Level-1 book. Please go through this fantastic bedside calculus book by Tarasov and two volumes of Piskunov.

- [**Calculus: Basic Concepts for High Schools**](https://archive.org/details/TarasovCalculus) by L.V. Tarasov

  ![Tarasov Calculus](images/tarasov_calculus.jpg)

- [**Differential and Integral Calculus, Volume 1**](https://archive.org/details/piskunov-differential-and-integral-calculus-volume-1-mir) by N. Piskunov

  ![Piskunov Calculus Volume 1](images/piskunov-calculus1.jpg)

- [**Differential and Integral Calculus, Volume 2**](https://archive.org/details/piskunov-differential-and-integral-calculus-volume-2-mir) by N. Piskunov

Please don't go for Maron or Spivak. These are surely overkill at this stage. Always remember your goal is to learn physics.

### Level 1: The Ultimate Physics Foundation

Now, the best Level-1 physics book ever was, is, will be written. If you understand English, this is a must-read book. Read cover-to-cover and solve every damn thing.

[**Physics by Halliday Resnick, Krane - Volume 1**](https://www.amazon.com/Physics-Halliday-Kenneth-Robert-Resnick-ebook/dp/B076DRCPB9) & [**Physics by Halliday Resnick, Krane - Volume 2**](https://www.amazon.com/Physics-2-David-Halliday/dp/0471401943). The Level 0 book mentioned above is essentially a diluted version of this and it requires heavy "application" of calculus.

8 hrs/day for 6 months doing the above and this would get you to a very proficient level in high-school physics.

### Level 1.5: The Irodov Challenge

Mastered RHK Level-1 physics problems? 🧠 Push your limits with these three Soviet masterpieces by I.E. Irodov! 🌟

- [**Problems in General Physics**](https://archive.org/details/IrodovProblemsInGeneralPhysics) by I.E. Irodov

  ![Irodov Problems in General Physics](images/irodov-problems.jpg)

- [**Problems in Mechanics**](https://archive.org/details/IrodovMechanics) by I.E. Irodov

  ![Irodov Problems in Mechanics](images/irodov-mechanics.jpg)

- [**Basic Laws of Electromagnetism**](https://archive.org/details/IrodovBasicLawsOfElectromagnetism) by I.E. Irodov

  ![Irodov Basic Laws of Electromagnetism](images/irodov-em.jpg)

Would rate all of the three as Level-1.5 books.

P.S. Wish he knew his rockstar status in India, with a cult following among JEE-Advanced students. 💪

### More Level-1.5 Soviet Gems

Two more Level-1.5 books. Two more Soviet Gems.
